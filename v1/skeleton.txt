Programming for Advanced Beginners - Robert Heaton 

board = new_board()


# Loop through turns until the game is over
loop forever:
  # TODO: need to figure out best way to do this
  # No problem, I'll come back later.
  current_player = ???

  # Print the current state of the board
  render(board)

  # Get the move that the current player is going
  # to make.
  move_co_ords = get_move()

  # Make the move that we calculated above
  make_move(board, move_co_ords, current_player)

  # Work out if there's a winner
  winner = get_winner(board)

  # If there is a winner, crown them the champion
  # and exit the loop.
  if winner is not None:
    print "WINNER IS %s!!" % winner
    break

  # If there is no winner and the board is full,
  # exit the loop.
  if is_board_full(board):
    print "IT'S A DRAW!!"
    break

  # Repeat until the game is over




Looking over this skeleton, I notice that it is made up of about 6 main components:

new_board => done. 
render => done.
get_move
make_move
get_winner
is_board_full
